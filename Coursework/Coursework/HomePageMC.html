              <p>Hi! Welcome to my website! My name is Finlay and through this site I plan to show you a few things about me and some of the skills I have acquired that could be useful in employment. </p>
              <p>Before we get to the boring part though, say hello to Sandy (and I'm there too I guess). This is my Labrador who was 3 months old when this photo was taken. Now he is about twice the age and size! When you see us on other pages, you can click on his very unconscious face to return to this page. </p>
              <img id="dogandMe" img src="Images\Sandy and me.jpg" alt="Photo of my dog asleep on top of me"> <!--This line will display an image found in the location found in the "img src". The "alt" tag will display text if the image is not found in the location in the src -->
              <p>Now that you know what I look like, and more importantly what my dog looks like, feel free to explore the rest of my site. It will tell you a bit about what I do, some of my projects and plans and ways in which to contact me, as well as an all important pet gallery.</p>
              <p> Oh. And as you can see if you look below this text, you'll see a button that will allow you to change to a bit more boring but maybe easier to read version of the site. </p>
