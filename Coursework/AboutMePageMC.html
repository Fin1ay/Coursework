          <p>Hello again. As you may have read, my name is Finlay Smith but my friends call me Fin. I am 19 years old as of November and currently am a first year in Robert Gordon's University. </p>

          <p>Since playing "Age of Empires II" on the old family desktop at the age of 8, I have loved computers. The complex processes that went on behind the screen did admittedly escape me at the time however as my interest in information technology grew throughout the years, I became more acutely aware of how much computers influence our day to day lives. I know that they have played a vital role in recent human development, all the way from the top secret breaking of German codes in World War II to the Virtual Reality Software that is opnely available today. I want to be part of the exponential growth that is taking place which is why I joined Robert Gordon University's computer science course in the first place.
          </p>

          <p> In addition to outdoor activities such as sea fishing, my main sporting passion lies with badminton. I have played competitively over many years and was scouted for The Island Games back in 2015, that were held in Sweden in 2017. I decided instead to focus on my academic work. However I continue to play badminton for a minimum of four hours per week and intend to continue the sport to the highest level possible in university. Out with school, I assist in the running of family-run self-catering accommodation. This requires an online presence; I am in charge of the web page design, maximizing tourist appeal. I help with property management and the welcoming of guests, as well as data management, financial management, synchronizing calendars and accounts. My sister has completed a BA in Administration and IT and she has mentored my learning of these skills. I enjoy all aspects of computer work and have an informal role in IT support for several family members. Music has played a significant part in my life, reaching grade 5 in cornet.
