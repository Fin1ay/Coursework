          <p>I have several goals in mind for the next few years in University. I will be taking as many opportunities as possible to expand my skill set in relation to web design and coding in programming languages such as Java and Javascript.  </p>


          <p>I have many projects currently in development, most of them involving the use of Javascript in their creation. This includes the following example code: </p>
          <p><a href = "Link can be added here">http://This_is_code...seriously...probably...fine_I_lied.com</a></p>
          <p><a href = "Link can be added here">http://Yet_another_completely_legit_URL_that_will_work.co.uk</a></p>
          <p><a href = "Link can be added here">http://One_more_for_luck.org</a></p>

          <p>In addition to this, I have played a part in the creation of a few minor websites including the following:</p>
          <p><a href = "http://Facebook.com">pfft. I obviously made this (don't look up credits)</a></p>
          <p><a href = "http://Twitter.co.uk">This one came to me in a dream</a></p>
          <p><a href = "http://Instagram.org">Made this one as a joke but it caught on</a></p>

          <p>Finally, I made these:</p>
          <p><a href = "">Okay</a></p>
          <p><a href = "">I've</a></p>
          <p><a href = "">Run</a></p>
          <p><a href = "">Out</a></p>
          <p><a href = "">Of</a></p>
          <p><a href = "">Jokes</a></p>

    <footer>
      <a href="E:\Course Work\Coursework\MyGoalsandProjectsMC.html"> <!--This serves to link the button to the "about me" page but with a different colour scheme-->
      <center><button>Change colour scheme</button></center> <!--This connects the above link to the a button -->
