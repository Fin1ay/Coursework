          <p>Hello again. As you may have read, my name is Finlay Smith but my friends call me Fin. I am 19 years old as of November and currently am a first year in Robert Gordon's University. I am an undergraduate in the Computing Science course.</p>

          <p>Since playing "Age of Empires II" on the old family desktop at the age of 8, I have loved computers. The complex processes that went on behind the screen did admittedly escape me at the time however as my interest in information technology grew throughout the years, I became more acutely aware of how much computers influence our day to day lives. I know that they have played a vital role in recent human development, all the way from the top secret breaking of German codes in World War II to the Virtual Reality Software that is openly available today. I wanted to be part of the exponential growth that is taking place which is why went all the way to Aberdeen from my home of Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides.
          </p>

          <p> I am a fluent Gaidhlig speaker, having been educated in the medium since the age of five. I feel that bilingual education has offered me great opportunities as well as improved communication skills. </p>

          <p> In addition to outdoor activities such as sea fishing, my main sporting passion lies with badminton. I have played competitively over many years and was scouted for The Island Games back in 2015, that were held in Sweden in 2017. I decided instead to focus on my academic work. However I continue to play badminton for a minimum of four hours per week continuing the sport to the highest level possible in university. Back home, I assisted in the running of family-run self-catering accommodation, which required an online presense I was in charge of before leaving to come to Aberdeen. My sister has completed a BA in Administration and IT and she has mentored my learning of some skills that helped me in this. I enjoy most aspects of computer work and have an informal role in IT support for several family members.</p>
